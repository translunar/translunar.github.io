## Science

Famous science journalist Carl Zimmer wrote an article about my graduate research (I'm not mentioned, but it's still cool):

## Policy

I co-founded [Texas Gun Sense](http://txgunsense.org), a 501(c)(3) that provides objective, fact-based research for the public and for lawmakers about firearms policy in Texas and the US. In 2014, the Obama White House recognized me for our work, along with a number of other amazing individuals.

Between 2007 and 2014, I wrote many, many articles on gun violence prevention, and there are about as many articles out there about our work.
