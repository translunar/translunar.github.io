**Hi, I'm Juno Woods, PhD.**

I do spacecraft navigation (state estimation), and mission design, with a focus on lunar missions. Sometimes I dabble in space settlement policy as well.

I perform engineering work on a contract basis. Please do reach out if you're interested in hiring Translunar LLC. My email address is at the bottom of the page and my CV is linked in the upper right-hand corner.

Briefly, here are some of the services I provide:

* Design and derive an extended Kalman filter, including measurement models for sensors.
* Spec out an inertial measurement unit (IMU).
* Conduct an observability analysis.
* Use a linear covariance analysis to specify navigation requirements, such as how often your sensors need to update along a given trajectory.
* Design or optimize a trajectory.
* Determine sensor location and mount angles and design a mission attitude timeline.
* Provide delta-v estimates and other types of error budgets.
* Size a reaction control system and analyze controllability using candidate optimal groups.
* Design an eigenaxis controller.
* Help you with approaching (berthing or docking) or departing the International Space Station.
* Various relative navigation problems, especially using LIDAR or cameras.
* Implement terrain-relative navigation designs.
* Select ground station locations for the best possible orbit determination solutions.
* Design a batch least squares estimator for incorporating two-way radiometric measurements.
* Write hardware-in-the-loop simulations in C, C++, and Python.
* Write proposals, business plans, or grant applications.

I'm [non-binary](https://transequality.org/issues/resources/understanding-non-binary-people-how-to-be-respectful-and-supportive) and my pronouns are they/them. I find that, in the aerospace industry, folks don't talk about gender or pronouns much. If you have questions, [MyPronouns.org](https://www.mypronouns.org) is a useful resource &mdash; or you can just ask me.
