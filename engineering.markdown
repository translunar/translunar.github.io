# Hi, I'm Juno Woods, PhD.

I do spacecraft navigation (state estimation), and mission design, with a focus on lunar missions, and dabble in space settlement policy. **I believe firmly that we cannot solve our environmental problems without moving heavy industry into space, which requires a sustained presence on the Moon.**

I perform engineering work on a contract basis. Please do reach out if you're interested in hiring Translunar LLC. My CV, which includes my email address, is linked in the upper right-hand corner.

Briefly, here are some of the services I provide:

* Design and derive an extended Kalman filter, including measurement models for sensors.
* Spec out an inertial measurement unit (IMU).
* Conduct an observability analysis.
* Use a linear covariance analysis to specify navigation requirements, such as how often your sensors need to update along a given trajectory.
* Design or optimize a trajectory.
* Determine sensor location and mount angles and design a mission attitude timeline.
* Provide delta-v estimates and other types of error budgets.
* Size a reaction control system and analyze controllability using candidate optimal groups.
* Design an eigenaxis controller.
* Help you with approaching (berthing or docking) or departing the International Space Station.
* Various relative navigation problems, especially using LIDAR or cameras.
* Implement terrain-relative navigation designs.
* Select ground station locations for the best possible orbit determination solutions.
* Design a batch least squares estimator for incorporating two-way radiometric measurements.
* Implement guidance algorithms for planetary landing.
* Write hardware-in-the-loop simulations in C, C++, and Python.
* Write proposals, business plans, or grant applications.

I do not work on any weapons systems.

I'm [non-binary](https://transequality.org/issues/resources/understanding-non-binary-people-how-to-be-respectful-and-supportive) and my pronouns are they/them. I find that, in the aerospace industry, folks don't talk about gender or pronouns much. If you have questions, [MyPronouns.org](https://www.mypronouns.org) is a useful resource &mdash; or you can just ask me.
