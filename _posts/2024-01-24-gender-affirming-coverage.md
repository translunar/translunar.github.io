Trans people face a number of challenges in getting gender-affirming
coverage. Some of these are political, such as living in states like
Florida, which are actively hostile to gender-affirming care. Many
challenges are largely apolitical, or occur even in politically friendly
states.

For example, health insurer provider networks are terrible, and
the wait for in-network surgeons is sometimes years long. Frequently,
health insurers write their policies misleadingly so patients believe
they are inelligible for common procedures such as facial feminization
or masculinatization surgery, bottom surgery, top surgery, hair removal,
hair transplants, etc. Non-network surgeons sometimes provide misleading information
as well, because they get enough business from people who can afford to pay out of pocket.

I am not a lawyer, nor am I a health insurance billing specialist. Yet
as a trans person who has sought gender-affirming care and moderates a
few gender-affirming care-related Discords, I've observed a number of
patterns.

It's impossible to provide a universal instruction manual,
even within the United States, because:

1. We have fifty states and even more territories, and over fifty sets of regulations for insurers, and each state/territory has one or more insurance regulators (California has two!). Network adequacy standards vary from state to state.
2. Not all plans are [Affordable Care Act-compliant](https://www.healthinsurance.org/glossary/aca-compliant-coverage/).
3. Different insurers have different procedures and policies and different [argots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cant_(language)).

In this article, however, I aim to provide you with an outline of a
plan, and the tools to prepare for likely obstacles.

## Caveats

* My expertise comes from personal experience, not from training.
* These instructions may not benefit people with fewer resources. They definitely benefit people with more free time.
* I wish I knew more about Medicaid/Medicare, [HMOs, and EPOs](https://www.coveredca.com/support/before-you-buy/plan-and-network-types/). If you're dealing with those, please take what I've written here with a helping of salt. Because I know nothing about them, I advise everyone to get a PPO, but I know of no reason these instructions wouldn't also work for an EPO or an HMO. I've heard of people using similar strategies with Medi-Cal.

## Overview

Here's a rough outline of the process of getting coverage for gender-affirming procedures:

1. Get diagnosed, assemble records and therapist letters.
2. Find a provider you like and determine the procedures you need.
3. Get your insurer to agree that the procedures are medically necessary.
4. Seek an exception to see the provider of your choice (if they are out-of-network).
5. Seek a letter of agreement or single case agreement for the insurer to pay the whole cost of surgery (minus your deductible).
6. File appeals, grievances, and complaints as needed.

## A quick note about examples

I'll frequently return to Anthem Blue Cross of California and Blue
Shield of California as examples, because I've worked with both of these
in the past. Hereafter, they'll just be Anthem and Blue Shield, but
please don't get them confused with their counterparts in other states,
where procedures may be different. I may also mention Kaiser; I'm
typically referring to the California PPO.

I'll also use the [California Department of Managed Health
Care](https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/) (DMHC), which is the larger of the two health insurance regulators
in California.

Analogous procedures should be available in any state that is reasonably
friendly to trans people and has a decent insurance regulator. Even if it doesn't, you may have [legal options](https://lambdalegal.org/newsroom/cp_wa_20231220_victory-blue-cross-blue-shield-of-illinois-may-not-exclude-gender-affirming-care-in-any-health-plan/).

## First things first: getting a good health insurance plan

This is the trickiest part. If you're employed as W-2, there's a decent
chance you'll be choosing from plans offered by your employer.

If possible, you should make sure your plan is compliant with the
Affordable Care Act (ACA). If you're buying an individual plan, you can do
this through your state's exchange or healthcare.gov.

The ACA funds so-called [navigators](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/navigator/) who can help you pick
a plan, and they're generally very good. In California, I send people to [Ask Ariana](https://askariana.com/) at least once a week. They're
simply wonderful, and can guide you on how to get subsidies, if
you're eligible for Medicare/Medicaid, whether you want an HMO/PPO/EPO,
and whether you should shell out for a bronze, silver, gold, or platinum
plan. Importantly, navigators' services are free to you. They can even sign you up for plans in some states.

My advice generally applies to PPOs. For reference, I have a Covered
California (ACA) Silver plan with Blue Shield, which is substantially
cheaper than its Gold or Platinum equivalents but has substantively
similar coverage. I've also dealt extensively with Anthem, as I
mentioned. I'm less familiar with Kaiser, though Kaiser is relatively good for gender-affirming care (at least in California).

If you have a choice of states, always pick the state with the better
regulator. You can't purchase across state lines, but maybe you have a
choice between residing in Florida or temporarily homesteading with
family in California. Research the regulator for the states in question
and make an informed decision.

Another key concern is how long your coverage will last. Are you
unemployed and likely to start a new job in three months? It could be
difficult to clear some hurdles with your individual plan in that amount
of time, and if you change insurers you'll have to start over.

Some big companies have what are called self-funded plans. Alphabet,
Meta, Apple, Starbucks, and others have special relationships with
insurers. If you get lucky enough to have one of these plans, you may
not need my help anymore. But remember that not all self-funded plans
are created equal.

You may also want to find out if your insurer has a case manager who
specializes in gender-affirming care. Blue Shield has several. Call them
and make friends. They can ease the process for you in many ways
(e.g. electrolysis coverage). Remember that these individuals are
employed by your health insurer and have an incentive to reduce your
utilization, so take what they say with some more salt.

## Cover your bases

You need a primary care provider (PCP) and a therapist at minimum.

The PCP usually has to assert that they've been treating you for gender
dysphoria (whose diagnosis code is [F64](https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/F01-F99/F60-F69/F64-/F64.0), by the way), usually for at
least a year. The exact requirements vary from insurer to insurer, but
are generally dictated by [WPATH](https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc).

The therapist has to write a letter whose contents are likely described in your
health insurance policy. Sometimes you need an additional letter from [a
provider who isn't your own](https://www.thegalap.org/).

Your plan may also require referral to a specialist.

## Look at the insurer's network provider list and find a provider you trust

Most of the time, health insurance networks are painfully bad, and it
takes months to see a specialist. With that said, if there is a network
provider that you trust to deliver the care you're seeking, that route
is likely to be easier than the non-network route. Either way, getting
in-network coverage for a non-network specialist requires you to show
that the network is insufficient in some way, so you should be generally
familiar with your options and have an idea already of why each provider
won't work.

The ACA requires that compliant plans provide you with a specialist
within a few dozen miles of your home, and generally within around
fifteen business days. The exact numbers may vary state to state and
specialty to specialty, but the distance and time requirements are two
of the strategies we can use to appeal for network exceptions.

Specialists also have
[scopes of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_of_practice). For
facial feminization or masculinization surgery (FFS/FMS), you may want
someone with all three of craniofacial, orthognathic, and plastic. Many
FFS/FMS surgeons provide chondrolaryngoplasties, which are tradtionally
otolaryngological surgeries. Even if you find one who does five of these
a week, there may be room to argue, "I want an ENT with an expertise in
working with vocalists for vocal feminization surgery, and this person
isn't an expert in vocal performance medicine." Gender-affirming care is
a specialty in its own right, but that doesn't mean you need to see a
person who mainly does bottom surgeries for a mastectomy.

For many specialties, the network simply won't have anyone with the
necessary expertise. Anthem has zero electrologists in its network as of
this writing. In cases like this, it's much easier to go out-of-network.

If you go with a non-network provider, ask them if they handle prior
authorizations (many do). You can also consider asking if they'll help
with gap exceptions or letters of agreement, but beware: they may try to
convince you that this route won't work, because it creates additional
work for them, and because they already have plenty of other customers
willing to pay out of pocket. Be kind and respectful, and remember that
they're not obligated to help you.

Network exceptions and prior authorizations are time-consuming, so if
you go out of network, try to find one provider of a service and stick
with them.

## But wait, I can't afford to pay out of pocket for a non-network provider

In this section, we get to the meat of the issue. Because of the ACA's
network adequacy requirements, you are entitled to seek a non-network
specialist if your insurance network lacks an in-network specialist.

Documentation is really important here. I suggest keeping a
communications log where you include a copy of each message you exchange
with your insurer (and every payment-related message with your provider
as well). Summarize phone calls, too. You may need to refer to this log
later, if/when you have to appeal a denial. I guarantee your insurer is
keeping such a log about you.

Here are a few useful concepts and tools:

### Prior authorization

Prior authorization (sometimes called precertification) is a statement
from your health insurer that a procedure is medically necessary. They
won't cover things that aren't. You'll need to provide documentation in
the form of medical records, letters from therapists, etc. You'll also
need an ICD diagnosis code (generally F64.x) and some set of CPT codes
that describe the procedures in question, e.g. 17380 for electrolysis,
along with the number of units of that procedure (sometimes in hours or
half hours or some other time increments). 

Your prior authorization also has to be associated with a specific
provider, and for that you'll generally need the provider's NPI and tax
ID. You can usually look up the NPI, but may have to ask them for the
NPI. You should also ask the provider you're using what CPT codes they
use if you're doing the authorization yourself. Medical billing is an
expertise in and of itself, and I find it particularly difficult to
locate correct CPT codes without simply asking the provider's billing
specialist.

If you don't receive prior authorization, your health insurer most
likely will not pay (or at minimum, getting reimbursed will be an uphill
battle), regardless of whether the provider is in their network.
 
Sometimes the provider will handle prior authorization for
you. Sometimes you can get your PCP to
help. [One Medical](https://www.onemedical.com) has been kind enough to
handle prior authorizations for electrolysis for some people. Sometimes
you may have to handle it yourself, but your provider will usually
provide you with the necessary CPT codes.

In general, it's a lot easier for the provider to do it, because they
typically have access to an electronic portal such as Availity. Some
insurers have forms (Blue Shield of California) and others have
"utilization management" phone numbers (Anthem Blue Cross). Most will
tell you the provider needs to submit the prior authorization, but
there's usually no authentication process unless you're using an online
portal.

Many insurers want all prior authorization documentation to be
faxed. There are inexpensive online fax providers that offer no
guarantees around privacy. I cannot recommend these. Some banks will fax
documents for free. If you do send a fax, keep in mind it might get
lost, so consider following up to verify receipt.

Some insurers also
[perform block denials of prior authorizations](https://www.propublica.org/article/cigna-pxdx-medical-health-insurance-rejection-claims),
or they'll deny you for cause (like missing records). There's a process
for appealing a denial which I'll discuss shortly.

Insurers may also reject requests for prior authorization if you submit
them too early. This line is usually about two to three months before
the procedure, which may actually work to your advantage when you get to
the next step.

### Network exception requests and network adequacy

Different insurers have different internal jargon for network exceptions
and slightly different processes for getting them, and it helps to know
the magic incantations to utter to service personnel.

You already got your health insurer to agree your proposed medical
intervention is medically necessary. With that agreement, it's possible
for you to seek a "network exception." Some insurers use the term
"access to care exception" instead, and may even claim that a gap
exception is something different. Sometimes you write a letter, and
sometimes you fill out a form. I suggest making your request in writing
unless completely unavoidable, and remember to put it in your log.

Think of a network exception as being based on three criteria:
1. Appropriateness of the specialization
2. Time until the specialist can see you
3. Distance from your home

I suggest arguing for exceptions using all three, if possible. For
example,

> Dr. A has craniofacial and plastics expertise, but I need a sliding
> genioplasty (CPT 21121), which requires orthognathic and maxillofacial
> expertise. Moreover, Doctor A's consult waitlist is two months, and
> the wait for surgery is even longer. Dr. B is an otolaryngologist, and
> is significantly less qualified than Dr. Lee to perform a type III
> craniotomy (CPT 21138); and Doctor B's consult waitlist is 5 months.

The insurer doesn't need to know you've been waiting for two years to
see Dr. Lee already. They don't need to know you already paid (if you
already paid).

They may also not grant the exception in time for your surgery, which
can be frustrating and expensive. If you wish to get reimbursed,
however, you absolutely need to at least show you *asked* for the
exception before you get surgery.

### Letters of agreement and single case agreements

Insurers have rate tables that they use to reimburse providers for
procedures. These rates are based on the
[CMS Fee Schedule](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/physician-fee-schedule/search/overview).
Usually an insurer will not tell you what their reimbursement rate is
for a specific procedure. Chances are, there's a significant difference
between that rate and what your non-network specialist is willing to
accept. Most of the time non-network providers refuse to negotiate with
insurers altogether. Your goal is to get your insurer to agree to the
price the doctor asks.

Remember that your insurer is under contract to provide you with
services, and it's often easier (less expensive) for them to agree to a
surgeon's fees than to find you an alternative provider.

I recommend asking the insurer for a letter of agreement (LOA),
sometimes called a single case agreement (SCA). The idea is that the
insurer negotiates an agreement to pay a specific price for your set of
procedures (which may end up being the actual cost you were quoted by the
provider).

Typically, non-network providers won't accept payment directly from the
insurer; they want you to pay up-front. However, sometimes an LOA or SCA
gets you around that obstacle. Whether it saves you from making a huge
up-front payment or not, the LOA/SCA prevents your insurer from doing a
bait-and-switch with your reimbursement. It should state how much the
insurer will pay for the procedure.

With procedures like bottom surgery, which have very long wait times,
you may have already had to pay for the procedure by the time you're
eligible to ask for a network exception. Unfortunately, I don't have a
clever way around this obstacle.

Sometimes it's possible to seek retroactive network exceptions,
particularly for lower-cost procedures with no network providers at all
(e.g. electrolysis). I don't recommend this approach unless you have no
other choice. If you do want to seek an exception retroactively, make
sure you can document that you contacted your insurer about the lack of
network options.

### Appeals and grievances

Most insurers routinely improperly deny prior authorizations and network
exception requests. It's almost guaranteed that at some point in this
process, you will need to file an appeal. Anthem makes appeals quite
easy (you can use Sydney, their online member portal), and takes the
maximum permitted amount of time to deny them (usually thirty
days).

If your appeal is denied, the next step is to file a grievance, also
with the insurer. The process is extremely similar to an appeal. They
may also deny the grievance after thirty days. If they ever take longer
than thirty days on an appeal or grievance, you can immediately jump to
filing a complaint with the state.

Last time I told Blue Shield I wanted to appeal something, they
emailed me a grievance form, and have referred to it in subsequent
communications as a grievance. This experience leads me to believe they
skip the appeal step, but your mileage may vary.

### Filing a complaint with the state

Once you've been denied on both appeal and grievance (or once they've
taken longer than thirty days to reply to either), you can ask the state
insurance regulator to intervene by filing a complaint. In California,
most of the time you deal with
[DMHC](https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/fileacomplaint.aspx) (but check, because
some plans answer to the California Department of Insurance).

Send DMHC all of your evidence that your insurer denied you improperly,
and tell them what you want:

> I'm seeking an access to care exception from Blue Shield of California
> for the CPT codes listed on the attached prior authorization, on the
> basis of diagnosis F64.0. BSC's network is inadequate because
> (reasons). BSC has already agreed that the attached CPT codes are
> medically necessary for me. I filed a grievance with the insurer and
> they failed to address the concerns raised.

If you got all your ducks in a row, DMHC will call your insurer and have
a conversation with them. Depending on the complexity of your claims,
they'll write you a letter explaining their decision or an attorney will
call you to discuss it.

Sometimes DMHC makes mistakes or gets the facts wrong. Typically your
first line option is to call them yourself (and they usually answer the
phone fairly quickly!). If you want to appeal one of their decisions,
you usually need to open a new complaint (and make sure to reference the
old one).

## Getting help from the community

Discord is one of the best places to go for help. I run the F64 Trans
Insurance Help Line, a Discord server (and you can contact me for an
invite). If you're getting a major gender-affirming procedure such as
bottom surgery or FFS/FMS, there's probably a surgery Discord for you. I
suggest asking around on Reddit for these.

## Getting professional help

I don't know of anyone who offers professional help with filing health
insurance appeals, but I know this is a profession that must exist. If
you know of someone, please leave a comment with their information.

I (and others) provide free advice on
[the F64 Discord](https://discord.gg/tKuMsprBz7), but if you want
someone to actually navigate the process for you, please consider hiring
me. I learned most of these lessons the expensive way, and getting paid
increases the amount of time I can afford to spend helping people who
can't pay.
